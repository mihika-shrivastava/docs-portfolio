# Developer Documentation Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of my **technical writing samples**.

## About Me
I‚Äôm a **software developer** and **aspiring technical writer** with ~3 years of experience building and documenting enterprise SaaS systems at Oracle. My background in Python, Java, SQL, and APIs enables me to bridge engineering depth with strong communication skills.  

I also write about technology, creativity, and communication on my Substack, [Coded Culture](https://codedculture.substack.com).  

I‚Äôm passionate about making complex systems understandable ‚Äî through tutorials, conceptual articles, and clear reference documentation.

## My Approach

Across all samples, I focus on:
- **Audience clarity:** Writing with empathy for developers and engineers.  
- **Structure and consistency:** Using logical flow, clear headings, and task-based organization.  
- **Technical accuracy:** Testing code samples and ensuring reproducibility.  
- **Style adherence:** Following widely recognized documentation standards, such as the [Google Developer Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style) and [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/).
