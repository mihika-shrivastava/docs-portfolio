# Why Great Documentation Is Just Great Storytelling

To most developers, documentation is just another checkbox they need to tick once the real work of development is done. But good documentation isnt just a technical afterthought. It is essentially a story of the software/product.



When you write comments in you code, you're saying *what* the code does. Documentation goes further - it explains *why* the code does that. It's in the why that the code turns from a sequence of functions into a story that one can follow.

Because really, what is good documentation if not a story well told?


## Structure is Story

Every great story follows a classic arc: setup, conflict, resolution. Documentation does it too. 

* It starts with a setup in the form of context - introducing what the software is, who is it for, why is it needed.

* Then comes the conflict or the problem - the question or problem that needs answering.

* And finally, we have the resolution, the solution to said issue — clarity, understanding, the moment when everything clicks.


When a document skips this structural arc and delves directly into the technical details, it can feel like starting a novel at Chapter 5 — one may catch up eventually, but the journey can be confusing. Structure gives the documentation its pacing.



## Empathy is the Main Character

Storytellers know their audience. So do technical writers.

Good documentation isnt just about explaining how something works -- it's about helping the reader understand it. It means anticipating where the reader may get lost and address it.
Empathy shows up in small ways, like defining jargon before it's introduced or explaining why a decision was made.


And the results speak for themselves. According to [Github's Octoverse 2021](https://octoverse.github.com/2021/#code-needs-documentation-to-become-a-project), developers saw a 55% jump in their productivity just by having access to basic documentation. That's empathy translated into clarity.


Because at its core, documentation is a conversation. 


## Cost of Silence

When documentation doesn't exist — or exists poorly — knowledge is trapped.

A [Stack overflow survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#productivity-impacts-knowledge) of over 73,000 developers found that nearly half said knowledge silos prevent them from getting ideas across teams. 57% of people managers said that they often find themselves asking the same questions over and over again. And about a quarter of the respondents reported that they couldn't find up-to-date information required to help them do their jobs.



A knowledge silo is what happens when even information that is recorded becomes confined within individuals or teams, figuratively trapped like grain in a silo. The knowledge exists, but it's inaccessible to others who might need it. And without proper documentation to bridge the gap, even simple questions can spiral into roadblocks. 



In fact, in [Panopto's "Value Workplace Knowledge" report](https://www.panopto.com/resource/valuing-workplace-knowledge/), 60% of the employees said that it is difficult, very difficult, or nearly impossible to get the information they need from a colleague, and on average, about 5.3 hours is spent every week waiting for answers that proper documentation could provide.

This isn’t just about incovinience — it’s lost time and momentum.

When information is locked away, teams lose their shared memory. Knowledge fades, work slows, and everyone starts rewriting the same story from scratch.


Good documentation doesn’t just preserve information — it keeps collaboration alive.


## Storytelling principles for a great Document

The parallels between storytelling and documentation run deeper than a metaphor. Storytelling gives writers their compass, the 5 Cs — Character, Context, Conflict, Climax, and Conclusion/Closure. These are the same principles which can be applied to documentation too.



| Stortelling principle | Documentation Parallel | What does that mean in docuemntation?|

|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|

|Character|The User|Understanding the audience, the reader of the documentation, is critical. That is what will guide the tone, structure, and even the examples in one's writing.|

|Context|The System| Answers questions like what does this tool do? Or why does it exist? It helps the user orient themselves before they delve into the details.|

|Conflict|The Problem|The user conflict we wish to address- a bug they can’t fix, that API call that won’t return what is expected, or a setup that keeps failing.

|Climax|The Resolution| It's the moment when the concept clicks. The example works, the integration is successful — the reader understands why the steps were taken.|

|Closure|Reinforcement|Here we can summarize key takeaways, link the user to next steps to be done — basically transform passive reading into retained understanding.



### Why It Matters

When documentation follows these principles, it stops being a checklist and becomes a journey. It doesn’t just tell someone what to do — it guides them.

Because at the end of the day, documentation isn’t about explaining code — it’s about helping someone navigate the unknown. And that’s what every good story does.



## Conclusion - The Quiet Art of Documentation

At its core, documentation isnt just about code, but it's also about communication. It's how teams preserve memory and how knowledge moves forward.


When you think about it, the best documentation already follows the structure of great storytelling. It has characters (users), context (the system), conflict (the problem), a climax (the resolution), and closure (the next steps). It even depends on the same storytelling virtues: clarity, empathy, and flow.



The data backs this up too — teams lose hours, even days, to knowledge silos and unshared information. But when documentation is done well, productivity rises, collaboration deepens, and the work itself starts to feel smoother and more human.



Because good documentation doesn’t just explain — it connects.
It translates complexity into understanding.
And maybe that’s the real story behind every great piece of software.
